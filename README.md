# PhonePe Pulse Data Visualization Dashboard


### Overview
The goal of this project is to extract data from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository, process it to obtain insights, and visualize it in a user-friendly manner. The solution involves extracting data, transforming it, inserting it into a MySQL database, and creating an interactive geo visualization dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly in Python.


### Features
1. **Data Extraction**: Clone the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository to fetch the data.
2. **Data Transformation**: Clean and preprocess the data using Python and Pandas.
3. **Database Insertion**: Connect to a MySQL database and insert the transformed data.
4. **Dashboard Creation**: Create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly.
5. **Data Retrieval**: Fetch data from the MySQL database to update the dashboard dynamically.
6. **Dropdown Options**: Provide at least 10 dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures on the dashboard.


### Approach
1. **Data Extraction**: Clone the GitHub repository and store the data in a suitable format (CSV or JSON).
2. **Data Transformation**: Use Python and Pandas to clean, preprocess, and transform the data.
3. **Database Insertion**: Connect to MySQL using "mysql-connector-python" and insert data using SQL commands.
4. **Dashboard Creation**: Utilize Streamlit and Plotly in Python to create an interactive dashboard with geo visualizations.
5. **Data Retrieval**: Connect to the MySQL database and fetch data into a Pandas dataframe for dynamic dashboard updates.
6. **Deployment**: Ensure the solution is secure, efficient, and user-friendly. Test thoroughly and deploy the dashboard publicly.


### Usage
1. Streamlit app
2. Use dropdown options to select different facts and figures on the dashboard.


### Technologies Used
- **Python**: For scripting and data manipulation.
- **Pandas**: For data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **MySQL**: For efficient storage and retrieval of data.
- **Streamlit**: For building the user interface.
- **Plotly**: For creating interactive visualizations.
